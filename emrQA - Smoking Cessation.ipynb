    "One fundamental issue when analyzing EHR data is determining what data is stored in discrete data fields as opposed to unstructured data stored in various notes in the health records. During a patient contact data can often times be stored in various notes found in the system. These could be progress notes, procedure notes, consultation notes, discharge notes or others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, unstructured data found in notes aren't considered useful and discarded, from an analytical perspective, because of the difficulty of gleaning information from the unstructured data. Meaningful use went a long way in ensuring specific data points in an EHR were stored discretely in the system so that they could later be reported on and used to make decisions about the patient or hospital operations. \n",

If the dataset was larger I would have enlisted the help of other individuals, preferably clinicians, at this point. The annotation process involved me writing the dataset to a .csv file and manually reading each discharge note. I believe this is appropriate since, though I am not a clinician, I have over 13 years of experience working in healthcare analytics. In addition, understanding a patient's smoking status from the discharge summary note is fairly straight forward.\n",

    "The one consideration I had during this process is for those patients where current smoking status is ambiguous. For some patients there is smoking information in the note text but it is uncertain if they are a current smoker or if they have smoked in their past. In these cases I erred on the side of annotating them as a smoker. Since this is a program to identify patients for smoking cessation overincluding isn't as much of a problem than missing a patient for potential smoking cessation outreach."

    "I was actually quite pleased with an over 76% accuracy rate to determine the smoking status of a patient from the full text of the discharge summary note. That is a six percent increase over the null accuracy score without doing much more than reading in the note text and running the model. However, there is a lot of noise in the note text itself and I wanted a way to gather more specific or discrete information from the note text and potentially use that information in the model.\n",

    "When exploring the data I got a hunch that whether or not a person drank alcohol seemed to correlate with their smoking status. More specifically, if a person didn't drink it seemed to follow that they often didn't smoke as well. This is completely anecdotal but I would like to dig into this a bit more. I wanted to find a way to identify the phrases or sentences in the note text that had to deal with alchohol consumption. Then I attempted to generate a positive or negative number by applying TextBlob's sentiment method to the phrase. No drinking seemed to return positive values while heavy drinker seemed to negative positive values. However I don't think I could isolate just the part of the sentence that dealt with alchohol in particular. This needs more work.\n",

It makes sense as it seems difficult to identify a current smoker with the text *quitting smoking* and *history of heavy smoking*. Those phrases imply historical use or quitting altogether. I think it would be difficult with a bag of words approach to undersand that nuance. Perhaps with a bigger data set or more likely the model understanding grammar and tense to a degree. The probability was a bit lower on this miss as well."
